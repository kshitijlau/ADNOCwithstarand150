Your task is to generate a concise and insightful leadership potential summary based on a candidate's assessment data. The output must be professional, behavioral, and strictly adhere to the format and rules outlined in the Appendix.

First, learn from these high-quality examples (golden standards):

EXAMPLE 1

INPUT DATA:

First Name: Ayesha, Gender: Female, Level: Guide

Scores: Overall_Leadership: 2.97, Drives_Results: 3.0, Leads_People: 3.2, Manages_Stakeholders: 2.4, Thinks_Strategically: 3.4, Solves_Challenges: 3.9, Steers_Change: 2.9

Strength Comment (Solves_Challenges): The candidate demonstrates strong ability to identify issues proactively and develop effective, logical solutions.

Strength Comment (Thinks_Strategically): The candidate demonstrates a solid understanding of both short-term and long-term strategic approaches to projects.

Development Comment (Manages_Stakeholders): The candidate would benefit from ensuring that the mutual objectives of relevant stakeholders are aligned and supported, to secure buy-in and sustain long-lasting relationships.

Development Comment (Steers_Change): The candidate would benefit from proactively seeking to understand the underlying reasons for change, to better sustain team motivation and engagement throughout the change process.

CORRECT OUTPUT:
Ayesha demonstrates average potential for growth and success in a more complex role. A confident and resilient problem-solver, she navigates ambiguity well and shows an awareness of the bigger picture. While she is adaptable to change and supports others' development, her drive to achieve goals can be inconsistent, and she may need support to remain decisive during uncertainty. Her primary development area is in stakeholder engagement, where she would benefit from building stronger, more collaborative relationships.

**Strengths:**

*   Demonstrates strong ability to identify issues proactively and develop effective, logical solutions.
*   Demonstrates a solid understanding of both short-term and long-term strategic approaches to projects.

**Development Areas:**

* Could benefit from ensuring that the mutual objectives of relevant stakeholders are aligned and supported, to secure buy-in and sustain long-lasting relationships.

* Would benefit from proactively seeking to understand the underlying reasons for change to better sustain team motivation.

EXAMPLE 2

INPUT DATA:

First Name: Badreyah, Gender: Female, Level: Apply

Scores: Overall_Leadership: 3.66, Drives_Results: 3.9, Leads_People: 4.2, Manages_Stakeholders: 4.2, Thinks_Strategically: 3.9, Solves_Challenges: 3.9, Steers_Change: 4.3

Strength Comment (Steers_Change): The candidate demonstrated strong comfort with changing environments and is supportive of adopting change initiatives.

Strength Comment (Leads_People): The candidate demonstrates high effectiveness in collaborating with the team to develop solutions and achieve shared goals.

Development Comment (Thinks_Strategically): Minimal development could be orientated towards improving task prioritization and effectively allocating workload to focus on strategically important activities.

Development Comment (Manages_Stakeholders): Minor development could be focused on developing strategies to maintain key relationships over the long term that support sustained business outcomes.

CORRECT OUTPUT:
Badreyah demonstrates high potential for growth and success in a more complex role. She excels in changing and complex environments, showing great adaptability and decisiveness. A natural leader, she inspires others and builds strong, trust-based relationships while focusing on team development. Badreyah consistently demonstrates high motivation to achieve results, approaches her work with a strategic focus on the bigger picture, and solves challenges with confidence. Her development can focus on scaling these impressive strengths for even greater complexity.

**Strengths:**

* Demonstrated strong comfort with changing environments and is supportive of adopting change initiatives.

* Demonstrates a high level of confidence in building relationships and understanding the needs of others.

Development Areas:

* Development could be orientated towards improving task prioritization and effectively allocating workload to focus on strategically important activities.

* Could focus on developing strategies to maintain key relationships over the long term that support sustained business outcomes.

APPENDIX: RULES AND MATRICES
1. Output Structure
Your final output must contain two parts:

Summary Paragraph: A single paragraph.

Bulleted Points: Two strengths and two development areas, each as a single-sentence bullet point.

Word count: the total word count of summary paragraph and bulleted points should be always less than 150 words.

As it has markdown formatting for strengths and development actions and the bullet points in them follow that as well. 

2. Generation Process and Rules
Follow this sequential process precisely.

Step 1: The Opening Sentence
Begin the summary paragraph with the sentence that corresponds exactly to the candidate's Overall_Leadership score, using the "Overall Leadership Potential Matrix" below. Use the candidate's first name.

Step 2: The Summary Paragraph Narrative
After the opening sentence, construct a narrative paragraph by performing the following:

Identify the candidate's Level (Apply, Guide, or Shape) to select the correct interpretation matrix.

Identify the 2-3 highest-scoring and 2-3 lowest-scoring of the six core competencies.

Weave a narrative that describes the candidate's profile. Start with the themes from the highest-scoring competencies, followed by the lower-scoring areas to provide a balanced view.

For each competency described, use the exact wording from the corresponding interpretation matrix. Do not name the competencies.

Crucially, conclude the paragraph by explicitly identifying the primary development area(s). For most profiles, use phrases like 'Her primary development area is...' or 'His development can focus on...'. For high-performing candidates with all high scores, frame this positively, such as 'Her development can focus on scaling these impressive strengths for even greater complexity.'

Ensure the paragraph flows naturally. The entire paragraph must be approximately 150 words.

Step 3: Bullet Point Selection

Strengths: Identify the two highest-scoring of the six core competencies. If there is a tie, select the competency with the most specific and behavioral strength comment from the assessor notes. Scores of 3.5 or above are always considered strengths.

Development Areas: Identify the two lowest-scoring of the six core competencies. Scores of 2.49 or below are always considered development areas. If all scores are high (e.g., above 3.5), select the two competencies with the relatively lowest scores. If assessor comments are minimal for the lowest score, you may select the next lowest score if its comment is more specific and actionable.

Step 4: Bullet Point Writing

For each of the four selected competencies, use the corresponding assessor comment as your source.

Rephrase the assessor comment into a single, concise, behavioral sentence. For strengths, use the "Strengths" comment. For development areas, use the "Development Areas" comment.

The bullet points must provide specific behavioral evidence and should not be general statements.

3. Writing Style and Constraints
Tone: Neutral, professional, objective, and behavioral.

Voice: Third person, present tense only (e.g., "She demonstrates," "He approaches").

Language: American English.

Forbidden Terms: Do not use the names of the competencies (e.g., "Drives Results"). Do not mention scores, numbers, AI, assessments, tools, or the assessment experience. Avoid vague or judgmental words like "good," "poor," "struggles," "strong," or "weak," unless they are part of the required interpretation text.

Pronouns: Use the candidate's correct gender pronouns.
